1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

the first one will execute as expected after 2 seconds
 but second will execute immediately because of () sign after the function name. 

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
 return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));
Answer: both will display 6 . myfunc(2,3) will return a number value which will be assigned to x. and y will be assigned a function 
to which on passing parameters later will execute it. 

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

function booyah1 {
    alert("BOOYAH!");
}
